<h2>Single Point High Speed Press (NHP)</h2>
<span></span>
<p><strong>FRAME</strong></p>
<p>Welded steel construction, stress relived, computer aided frame design, extreme rigidity with uniform parallel deflection, ideal for progressive tooling, ensure high speed laminating precision and rigidity</p>
<br><p><strong>SLIDE</strong></p>
<p>The slide is guided accurately throughout the whole stroke with high precision eight way bearing guides free from backlash. Eight point, square corner gibbing provides long parallel guiding surface that maintain slide parallelism under off centre load resulting high precision &amp; long tooling life.</p>
<br><p><strong>CRANK SHAFT</strong></p>
<p>It is made from a forged piece of carbon alloy steel. Shaft is ground  finished on bearing surface. All main bearing are of heavy walled nickel phosphorous and bronze.</p>
<br><p><strong>DYNAMIC BALANCING</strong></p>
<p>Provides better precision quality of lamination and longer life by controlling the thursh and vibration in the frame generated by crank shaft rotation.</p>
<br><p><strong>PLUNGER GUIDE</strong></p>
<p>The rotation of eccentric shafts creates front &amp; back loads that changes guides clearance this is controlled by plunger guided design this eliminates change in guide clearance resulting high precision.</p>
<br><p><strong>HYDRAULIC SLIDE ADJUSTMENT LOCKING DEVICE</strong></p>
<p>This eliminates clearances inside the slide adjustment assembly. Maintain accuracy of slide travel at bottom dead centre.</p>
<br><p><strong>STICK RELEASE DEVICE</strong></p>
<p>Resolves tool jam problem, easy to operate</p>
<br><p><strong>LUBRICATION</strong></p>
<p>Motorised forced feed lubrication is of re&ndash;circulating type ensures adequate oil supply,depending upon the bearing area ensures cooling of bearing as well as any fault in the system with cause instant stopping of the press and will be shown optically on control pannel.</p>
